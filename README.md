# SimCovox - Atmega arduino mini.

This is simple simcovox for people, who do not like to modify their precious Atari computer.

The code for Atmega328p was adopted from another project, so some settings are unneccessary.

I do not want to make too much time spending cleaning up the code, it works as it is.
